      <h1 className="self-advocacy-title">The Cost of Self-Advocacy: My Fight for Justice</h1>
      <p className="self-advocacy-content">
        Self-advocacy doesn’t always result in immediate victory or protection. Sometimes, the cost is high, 
        but the importance of standing up for yourself remains crucial. It is often portrayed as the path 
        to empowerment, but what happens when that path leads to even greater struggles. For me, advocating 
        for myself has come at a significant cost. I’ve stood up for my rights and ended up unemployed and 
        fighting for justice.
      </p>
      <p className="self-advocacy-content">
        In reality, self-advocacy is not always about empowerment in the moment—it’s about survival. It’s 
        about standing up even when the odds are against you, even when history and systems are not designed 
        to protect people like me—a Black woman. In my experience, the consequences of speaking out were severe, 
        but the alternative was silence, and I refused to let that be my story.
      </p>
      <h2 className="self-advocacy-subtitle">The Personal Cost of Advocating for Myself</h2>
      <p className="self-advocacy-content">
        In 2016, after advocating for myself, I found myself unemployed, struggling financially, and questioning 
        whether speaking up was worth it. Then again, in 2018, I fought back after being sexually harassed and 
        retaliated against, and the result was the same. Meanwhile, the supervisor who lied, the coworker who 
        touched me, and the director who dismissed my complaint all continue their careers, unaffected.
      </p>
      <p className="self-advocacy-content">
        I’ve come to understand that the laws are not always designed to protect the victim. As a Black woman, 
        I feel this truth even more deeply. Historically, Black women have not been protected in the workplace, 
        and my fight for justice feels like a continuation of that painful history. But I refuse to be silenced.
      </p>
      <h2 className="self-advocacy-subtitle">The Fight Continues</h2>
      <p className="self-advocacy-content">
        This journey isn’t over for me. My case continues, and so does my fight for justice. I will keep advocating 
        for myself, not because it’s easy, but because it’s necessary. To those reading this, remember: advocating 
        for yourself may come with a cost, but silence will cost you even more.
