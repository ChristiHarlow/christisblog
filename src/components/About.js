  Welcome to my blog! I’m Christi, and I’m glad you’ve found your way here. 
  This blog is a space where I share my journey of healing, growth, and the life experiences that have shaped me along the way. 
  From navigating challenging workplaces and standing up to sexual discrimination, race discrimination, and retaliation, to confronting microaggressions and systemic racism, I reflect on the emotional, psychological, and professional toll these experiences take. This blog serves as a space to explore the adversities I’ve encountered and the lessons I’ve learned through them, including my journey of discovering new passions in web development and beyond.

  You’ll find posts on topics like microaggressions in the workplace, resilience through tough times, 
  and how we can all grow through adversity. After a five-year journey of fighting for my rights, 
  I've learned that healing takes many forms, and growth often comes from the most unexpected places.

  My hope is that this blog can serve as a space for open dialogue, reflection, and empowerment. 
  Whether you’ve experienced similar challenges or are simply looking for inspiration on your own journey, 
  I hope my experiences resonate with you and spark meaningful conversations. 
  Thank you for joining me on this path of healing and growth.
