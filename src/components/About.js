        Welcome to my blog! Iâ€™m Christi, and here I share my journey of healing,
        growth, and life experiences. You'll find posts on topics like racism and 
        discrimination, personal development, and many other subjects that have shaped 
        my life. I hope to create a space for open dialogue and reflection.
